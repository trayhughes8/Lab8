# Robert Hughes -- GEOG676 -- Lab 8: GitHub ePortfolio 

# Solution Outline
1. The Software and Development structure for this project will be focusing on Visual Studio Code (VSC), and ArcPY. The example can be found in [Lab 1](https://github.com/trayhughes8/Hughes-GEOG676).
2. **Reading Databases:** Accessibility to all databases from different sources will be sorted through our software that can easily be used for future analysis projects. The example can be found in [Lab 3](https://github.com/trayhughes8/Lab3).
3. **Well Coordinates:** This could be an important tool to use for future coordinates projects. Being able to check and determine the accuracy of the coordinates from different well locations through a well database. The example can be found in [Lab 2](https://github.com/trayhughes8/Lab2VSC).
4. **Write to Master Well Geodatabase:** Exporting the results into a main Geodatabase (gdb) after checking the accuracy of the well locations. The example can be found in [Lab 4](https://github.com/trayhughes8/Lab4).
5. **Feature Operations:** Buffering (a tool that creates a polygon around a point, line, or polygon feature to define an area within a specified distance) can be used to determine if the wells were put in NAD83 vs NAD 27. The example can be found in [Lab 5](https://github.com/trayhughes8/Lab5).
6. **Master Well Location:** Building  a graduated color well to provide confidence of Master Well location. By using graduated colors, it can help with being able to sort through what is needed and what is not. This could be useful with small or large amounts of data. The example can be found in [Lab 6](https://github.com/trayhughes8/Lab6).
7. **Aerial Images:** Adding aerial images to support the database could prove extremely benefical in providing a unique way to view a perspective that could not be seen from ground level. The example can be found in [Lab 7](https://github.com/trayhughes8/Lab7).
