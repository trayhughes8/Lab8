# Robert Hughes -- GEOG676 -- Lab 8: GitHub ePortfolio 

# Solution Outline
1. The Software and Development structure for this project will be focusing on Visual Studio Code (VSC), and ArcPY. The example can be found in [Lab 1](https://github.com/trayhughes8/Hughes-GEOG676).
2. **Reading Databases:** Accessibility to all databases from different sources will be sorted through our software that can easily be used for future analysis projects. The example can be found in [Lab 3](https://github.com/trayhughes8/Lab3).
3. **Well Coordinates:** This could be an important tool to use for future coordinates projects. Being able to check and determine the accuracy of the coordinates from different well locations through a well database. The example can be found in [Lab 2](https://github.com/trayhughes8/Lab2VSC).
4. **Write to Master Well Geodatabase:** Exporting the results into a main Geodatabase (gdb) after checking the accuracy of the well locations. The example can be found in [Lab 4](https://github.com/trayhughes8/Lab4).
5. **Feature Operations:** Buffering (a tool that creates a polygon around a point, line, or polygon feature to define an area within a specified distance) can be used to determine if the wells were put in NAD83 vs NAD 27. The example can be found in [Lab 5](https://github.com/trayhughes8/Lab5).
6. **Master Well Location:** Building  a graduated color well to provide confidence of Master Well location. By using graduated colors, it can help with being able to sort through what is needed and what is not. This could be useful with small or large amounts of data. The example can be found in [Lab 6](https://github.com/trayhughes8/Lab6).
7. **Aerial Images:** Adding aerial images to support the database could prove extremely beneficial in providing a unique way to view a perspective that could not be seen from ground level. The example can be found in [Lab 7](https://github.com/trayhughes8/Lab7).

# Lab 8 ePortfolio Planning Discussion/Project Goal
The Planning Discussion/Project Goal is to provide a solution in mastering the well databases from different databases. In order to accomplish this goal, we will be using Visual Studio Code and ArcPy softwares to build a tool that will import all data opinions of well locations, inverse between all the data and write to Master Well Location, build a check that determines if the coordinate was NAD83 vs. NAD 27, and to build a tool that allows users to select the Master Well Location from different aerial images.

# Justify the Return on Investment (ROI)
By creating a Master Well Location database, it will overall reduce time spent working on the project, as well as reducing the amount of errors that are bound to happen over time. These exact examples happen time and time again, and this would be a solution to those problems. On top of saving time, effort, and errors, this would also save the company money in the long run.

# Interface With Users
ArcPy and ArcGIS Pro are both user firendly and can be downloaded and used on numerous platforms, giving them the ultimate flexibility. That is why we are using both softwares in developing our system to ensure usability with our clients.

# Gather Requirments
By using ArcPy, we will be able to read and execute on any databases that are given to our team. ArcPy will do the heavy lifting. 

# Software and Databases being used
As mentioned before, the two softwares we will be using are Visual Studio Code and ArcGIS Pro. Visual Studio Code will be used to utilize ArcPy on the programming side, and ArcGIS Pro will be used to test and ensure that our products are fully functioning before delivering our product.

# Status Updates
Status updates, as well as report updates, change depending on the customer. Our company is flexible enough to discuss what the customer would want for updates, and we then create a schedule to meet those needs. If we cannot meet those specific times or flexibility, then we will create a meeting to discuss further.

# Deploy, maintain, and archeive your softare
We will charge an initial fee for deploying our product with the customers. After the initial deployment, there will be a monthly charge for maintaining and storing any data to do with the final product of the project.
